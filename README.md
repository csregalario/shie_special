This is for my Ecommerce Lesson

This project is a sample CRUD - Create Read Update Delete.

this assumes you already have XAMPP or any localhost server installed.

1. create a database called "lecture"
2. import or execute the lecture_.sql to create the users table.
3. download and copy the scripts to a "lecture" folder in your htdocs in your localhost server (Xampp)
4. in your browser. go to /localhost/lecture
